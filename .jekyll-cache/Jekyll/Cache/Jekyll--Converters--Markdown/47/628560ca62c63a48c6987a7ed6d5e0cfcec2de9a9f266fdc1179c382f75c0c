<p>Hello Folks,</p>

<p>I am starting new detailed blog series on new Urban Farming Technologies this has proven their need, importance and the future oppourtunities across the globe.</p>

<p>This blogging series will be more of sharing my practical experiences, my experiements and mistakes I did during the journey of building my Hydroponics System.</p>

<p>We all know importance of the Neurtrious foods in our daily life.</p>

<p>Lets try to understand insights of this Urban Farming Technology:</p>

<h1 id="what-is-hydroponicssoilless-farming-"><strong>What is Hydroponics/Soilless Farming ?</strong></h1>

<p>Most of us have heared a buzz words like ‚Äú<strong>Hydroponics</strong>‚Äù or ‚Äú<strong>Soilless</strong>‚Äù farming</p>

<p>When we tell people that we grow our daily produces using hydroponics, we usually get something close to this response:</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúSounds cool‚Ä¶sounds like it has something to do with health food maybe? What even is it?‚Äù</em></p>

<p>For all the hydro-curious folks out there, I am trying to explain in simple terms</p>

<p><strong>Put simply:</strong> Hydroponics is a way to skip the soil,sub in a different material to support the roots of the plant, and grow crops directly in nutrients-rich water.</p>

<p>In Hydroponics there is no need of <strong>Soil</strong> to grow crops, In traditional farming Soil is used as supportive element to hold the roots of the plants and plants get the required nutrients from the soil.</p>

<p>Where as In Hydroponics plant absorbs all the required neutrients directly from the water and grows faster than the soil.</p>

<h1 id="how-it-is-different-than-the-traditional-farming-"><strong>How it is different than the Traditional Farming ?</strong></h1>

<p>As we all know how the Farmer prodces the crops, vegitables and all other yields which we need on the daily basis, we all know India is the Nation of Agricultural Land <strong>‚ÄúKrushi Pradhan Desh‚Äù</strong> and in traditional farming 3 important elements are required</p>
<ul>
  <li>Huge Land Area</li>
  <li>Plenty of Water</li>
  <li>Fertilizer and Pestecides to protect crop from insects and disease</li>
</ul>

<p>Talking about Hydroponics,</p>

<p>This seemingly subtle shift in how we make food (skipping the soil, that is) is actually revolutionary ‚Äì‚Äì it allows growers to produce food anywhere in the world, at any time of the year, and to net higher yields with fewer resources.</p>

<p>Where as in Hydroponics System Plants are grown in the nutrients based water within a controlled and enclosed environment where plant don‚Äôt need to strugle to get the required nutrients from the water.</p>

<p>This system focuses on controling the pH of the water, Electrical conductivity, Humidity, Temperature, Pressure,Lighting conditions and nutrients requirment of the yields.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fresh water.</strong> Were talking primo,filtered stuff with a balanced pH. Most plants like water with a pH level around 6 to 6.5.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Oxygen:</strong> Roots will take the dissolved oxygen from the water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Root Support:</strong> Even though you don‚Äôt need soil, your plant‚Äôs roots still need a little something to hold on to. Typical materials include vermiculite,perlite, peat moss, coconut fiber and rockwool. Stay away from materials that might compact(like sand) or that don‚Äôt retainany moisture (like gravel).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Nutrients:</strong> Plant is going to need plenty of <strong><em>magnesium,phosphorus, calcium,</em></strong> and other nutrients to stay healthy and productive ‚Äì‚Äì just like plants growing in the ground need healthy soil and fertilizer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Light:</strong> Light is the source of energy like we get the D-vitamin from the Sun light, plant also need the light spectrum to grow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-all-crops-we-can-grow-using-hydrophonics"><strong>What all crops we can grow using Hydrophonics?</strong></h1>
<p>It is best suited for all kinds of vegitables like Tomatoes,Lettuce,Cucumber,Spring onions,Peppers,Spinach,Basil,Coriander and many more‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="advantages-disadvantages-of-hydroponics-compared-to-soil-based-farming-">Advantages, Disadvantages of Hydroponics compared to Soil based farming ?</h2>

<p><strong>Advantages :</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>No huge land investment and Soil is not required,no need of pestecides and fertilizers.</li>
  <li>Yields can be produced <strong>27x7</strong> across the year in almost 80-90% less water compared with soil.</li>
  <li>Can be able to fulfill the demand by automating the systems and plants can be grown in a very controlled and managed environments.</li>
  <li>Less Man power more automation invloved.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantes :</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial setup cost is more.</li>
  <li>Need the precise control and monitoring of the various parameters like pH, EC, temperature, humidity and Nutrients levels as per the types of plants.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hydrophonics-the-future-of-farming"><strong>Hydrophonics the Future of Farming</strong></h1>

<p>As the world population continues to grow, the challenge is to produce more food whilst being more sustainable. To assist with this, more technologies are coming into play. Hydroponic technology, which allows producers to grow plants without soil.</p>

<p>In 2015, the United Nations predicted that the world population will grow to 9.6bn by 2050 and 70% of the population will live in cities.</p>

<p>Future of this field will be like a shining sun in upcoming time.</p>

<p>All the countries have already taken the active initiatives and number of Tech startups across the globe are producing the fresh organic yields.</p>

<p>It is a Billion Dollar Industry In India, at present Agriculture is contributing at 14-18% of total GDP, seems to have plenty of oppourtunities in near-future.</p>
