I"§<p>Hey I just got this a very powerful Texas Instruments <strong>Tiva C Series TM4C123G</strong> <strong>ARM-Cortex M4F</strong> launchpad to work around RTOS(Real Time Operating Systems). I thought lets gets introduced with this powerful 32-bit ARM Cortex M4F based device having very good online and offline <span style="color:#33cccc;"><a style="color:#33cccc;" href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl#supportandcommunity">community support</a> </span>for beginner and professional developers  from TI.</p>

<p>I am very much interested to soon get you on the tour of RTOS supported by this MCU, but before getting it more complex lets start from the basic introduction of MCU board, Tools required for programming, list of supported RTOS and many more on the bucket, I will get it one by one for you.</p>

<p>Here we will gets familiar with Tiva C Series Launchpad, and its hardware features , pinouts and software tools ‚Ä¶.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff9900;">Introduction to Tiva C Series</span> <span style="color:#33cccc;"><a style="color:#33cccc;" href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/spms376e/spms376e.pdf">TM4C123G ARM</a></span>-Cortex-<span style="color:#33cccc;"><a style="color:#33cccc;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M">M4F</a> </span>:</strong></p>

<p>Lets us understand about ARM-Cortex-M4 Core first , Here The <b>ARM Cortex-M</b> is a group of <a title="32-bit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit">32-bit</a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Reduced instruction set computer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a> <a title="ARM architecture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a> processor cores licensed by <a title="ARM Holdings" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Holdings">ARM Holdings</a>. The cores are intended for <a title="Microcontroller" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller">microcontroller</a> use, and consist of the Cortex-M0, M0+, M1, M3, M4, and M7 cores.</p>

<p>Cortex-M4 processor Core is very commonly used in industries for various applications as below beacause of ‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
	<li>The ARM<sup>¬Æ</sup> Cortex<sup>¬Æ</sup>-M4 processor is ARM‚Äôs high performance embedded processor developed to address digital signal control markets that demand an efficient, easy-to-use blend of control and signal processing capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The combination of high-efficiency signal processing functionality with the low-power, low cost and ease-of-use benefits of the Cortex-M family of processors is designed to satisfy the emerging category of flexible solutions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Specially prefers this core for applications like this :The motor control, automotive, power management, embedded audio and industrial automation, and mainly used in Home Automation and Building Automation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well there is lot more to talk on this , you guys also can explore about Cortex-M4 core.</p>

<p>We will now focus on some thing practical things , I mean about Tiva C Series Launchpad and lets understand more about its specifications and pin-outs and some other use cases.</p>

<p>Well guys this tutorial was just an introductory tutorial  for giving you introductions about hardware and software tools for programming .</p>

<p>We will soon going to live for creating our first Tiva C Series TM4C123G ARM-Cortex-M4F projects and also we are going to create an <strong>TI-RTOS(SYS/BIOS)</strong> based projects in CCS6.1.</p>

<p>Guys stay tune with me to explore on programming and developing interesting application with ARM-Cortex systems.</p>

<p>Cheeerrrrrr‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..</p>
